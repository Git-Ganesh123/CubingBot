# CubingBot
Attempt at using gemini api to create a rubik's cube themed chatbot using data scarped from WCA website including records and results.

<h3> Current State - </h3>
<h4> The python file is in the works. Gemini API is connected and works but the responses are quite arbitrary and I'm trying to get the responses to be based on data fetched from the WCA site so they are precise. </h4>

<h4> The html is still in test conditions. Currently does not make use of the python code, but the aim will be to run this bot on its own site with css and js implemented.</h4>

<h3> Libraries used </h3>
<h4> 
  BeautifulSoup library for web scraping <br>
  google.generativeai to access gemini API
  requests used to fetch url 
</h4>
